# Pattern Recognition Game
A game built around the same principles that [L-Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) are based on. However it uses those principles to generate a random string of text that is then printed to the user, the job of the user is to recognise the pattern and type it into the input field, the input will then be evaluated against the origional string and a correct/incorrect result will be determined. 

## Backstory
I got the idea for this admittedly pretty dumb game while taking a shit. I had watched a YT video on L-Systems a few weeks prior, which sparked my mild obsession with them; hence why I was thinking about them while on the shitta.
